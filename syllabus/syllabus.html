	<h3>Client Server Concepts</h3>

		<p>The client-server model, or client-server architecture, is a distributed application framework dividing tasks between servers and clients, which either reside in the same system or communicate through a computer network or the Internet. The client relies on sending a request to another program in order to access a service made available by a server. The server runs one or more programs that share resources with and distribute work among clients.

	The client server relationship communicates in a request–response messaging pattern and must adhere to a common communications protocol, which formally defines the rules, language, and dialog patterns to be used. Client-server communication typically adheres to the TCP/IP protocol suite. </p>

	<h3>Components of Web Application</h3>
	<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hxi_TdLLxUuhp0rk6_p4qA.png" height=250 width=350 >
		<p>Web application architecture comes with two types of web application architecture: Structural components, and user interface app components.</p>
		<h5>Structural Components:</h5>
		As the name suggests, these components make the structure of the application. These components include the client or web browser, database server, and web app server which are directly responsible for functions deciding the user interactions within the application. In the majority of cases, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are used to create these components. However, it all varies with the web app developer.
		<h5>User Interface Components:</h5>
		The other one is the user interface components that contribute to the visual interface of the app. However, unlike structural components, that do not interact with the architecture, but are limited to displaying the web page. These components include a dashboard, widget, settings, notifications, and many other visual elements that help in making the user experience better. In other words, these components are directly responsible for the UX or the web app.

	<h3>Types of Web Content</h3>
	<img src="http://www.ezibeline.com/Content/Page/Images/Upload/web-content-types.jpg" height=250 width=300 >
		<p>The Web content is the text, visual or audio content that is made available online and user encountered as part of the online usage and experience on websites. It may include text, images, sounds and audio, online videos, among other items placed within web pages.

In the book Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville wrote, "We define content broadly as 'the stuff in your website.' Web content may include webpage document pages, information, software data and applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages, archived e-mail messages stored on email servers, and more. And we include future web content as well as present web content roadmap. </p>

<div id="http">
	<h3>HTTP Overview </h3>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRMXe2EOZEtR0BJv2-qDxkW9vDKNhtei7siBg&usqp=CAU" height=250 width=500 >
		<p>It stands for hypertext transfer protocol. Using this protocol the client sends a request to the server and based on the request the server and the web browser respond to the client. In a nutshell, we can say that it’s the base using which one computer (the client) communicates with another (the server).
Request line:- It specifies the method, which tells the server what to do with the information or resource. It contains the URL of the request which is used to find the resource on the server. It also specifies HTTP protocol version being used (Ex. HTTP/ 1.0 or HTTP/1.1)</p>

<p>An HTTP response is made by a server to a client. The aim of the response is to provide the client with the resource it requested, or inform the client that the action it requested has been carried out; or else to inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request.As in a request message, each HTTP header is followed by a carriage return line feed (CRLF). After the last of the HTTP headers, an additional CRLF is used (to give an empty line), and then the message body begins.

<div id="5"><h3>Generation of dynamic web pages</h3></a>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Scheme_dynamic_page_en.svg/1200px-Scheme_dynamic_page_en.svg.png" width="250" height="250" alt="dynamic">
<p>A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using JavaScript running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript can interact with the page via Document Object Model, or DOM, to query page state and modify it. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included. </p>
<div id="6"><h3>Application Servers</h3></a>

<p>An application server is a server that hosts applications[1] or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol.[2]

An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software components available to a software developer through an application programming interface. An application server may have features such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to focus on the business logic.</p>
<div id="7"><h3>Web security</h3></a>

<p>

Web security refers to protecting networks and computer systems from damage to or the theft of software, hardware, or data. It includes protecting computer systems from misdirecting or disrupting the services they are designed to provide.

Web security is synonymous with cybersecurity and also covers website security, which involves protecting websites from attacks. It includes cloud security and web application security, which defend cloud services and web-based applications, respectively. Protection of a virtual private network (VPN) also falls under the web security umbrella.

Web security is crucial to the smooth operation of any business that uses computers. If a website is hacked or hackers are able to manipulate your systems or software, your website—and even your entire network—can be brought down, halting business operations.
